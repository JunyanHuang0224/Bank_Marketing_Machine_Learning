# Bank_Marketing_Machine_Learning
As telemarketing is facing the high cost but low reward dilemma, utilizing machine learning techniques can greatly improve the situation. Among machine learning algorithms, classification has been widely applied in the marketing industry. This paper presents the project working on a bank telemarketing data set utilizing classification models, exploring both Decision Tree and Random Forest to train different predictive models. To increase the prediction strength of the models, this project will apply data balancing and feature selection techniques prior training the predictive models and comparing the models with confusion matrix and ROC plot. After the comparison analysis, this paper outlines how the data balancing and feature selection techniques work to improve the prediction strength of the models and compares the performance of the decision tree models and random forest models.
